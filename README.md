# Fredie-And-Friends-Coffee
A group project in creating a web application containing a fictional database for coffeeshops and what we think one
may look like.

Table creation and test data can be found in `tablescript.sql` and
`insert_test_data.sql` respectively. There are no users at the start,
please register to use the website.

## Database Schema ##
We designed our database according to this schema diagram.
![schema](/schema.png "Schema")

This schema diagram reflects the expectations we had for the final product.
They were mostly met, a few features that are not in the current version include

1. displaying supplier info
2. adjusting stock at runtime based on orders
3. creating invoices.

These were not done to leave time to complete the main features,
which were creating orders and letting employees check them off, as well
as displaying the employee schedules, and creation of customer profiles.
