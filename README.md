# Fredie-And-Friends-Coffee
A group project in creating a web application containing a fictional database for coffeeshops and what we think one
may look like.

Table creation and test data can be found in `tablescript.sql` and
`insert_test_data.sql` respectively. This will also be included at
the bottom of the README file.
There are no users at the start, please register to use the website.

## Database Schema ##
We designed our database according to this schema diagram.
![schema](/schema.png "Schema")

This schema diagram reflects the expectations we had for the final product.
They were mostly met, a few features that are not in the current version include

1. adjusting stock at runtime based on orders
2. creating invoices ready made to be handed in to tax authorities

These were not done to leave time to complete the main features. Thus,
many important expectations and features were met, such as
1. creating orders online
2. letting employees check them off
3. displaying the employee schedules
4. creation of customer profiles
5. storing history of orders

Overall the website is quite useful :)
